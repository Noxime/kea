# Kea Engine
Kea engine is a cross-platform, cross-api lightweight game engine for 2D 
games. It is mostly written to support my own game projects, but it 
might be a useful start for you to learn how to port to different 
platforms or how to design a somewhat-functional engine in Rust. 
**Please note:** I am not a professional engine developer, so my code is 
not the perfect.
